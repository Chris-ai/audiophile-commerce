This is a multi-page e-commerce website facilitating the browsing and purchase of audio products such as headphones, speakers, etc... The site is crafted using cutting-edge technologies and designed responsively to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Data is sourced from a local <code>data.json</code> file and injected into the application. The shopping cart functionality is saved in <code>local storage</code> to ensure persistent user preferences.
